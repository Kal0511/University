Simple Proxy Server Instructions
made by Kaumil Patel 30088096

The application was build and tested on my personal laptop. Wireshark, telnet and firefox was used for testing and debugging the porgram.

The server supports HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 requests and responses. 
The porxy is able to parse requests and responses that are sent through and extracts key information like the method, path, version, host, content type, and content length. 
These details are used to connect to diffrent servers and fullfil the clients requests. 
The porgram is also able to filter the url and the body of requests and responses to block bad content. 
When content is block the client is redirected to an error page.
The admin can connect to the server on a special port to dynamically change the filter list and the blocking status.
