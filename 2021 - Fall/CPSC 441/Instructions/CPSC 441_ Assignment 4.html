<h1>Assignment 4: RFID Scanning (40 marks)</h1>

Due: <b>Friday, December 3, 2021</b> (11:59pm)

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to learn about Medium Access
Control (MAC) protocols, which regulate access to a shared channel.
In particular, you will study a slotted-time protocol
similar to those used in high-tech RFID scanning systems.
While doing so, you will reinforce key concepts regarding
multiple-access protocols (e.g., shared channel, multiple nodes,
random access, collisions, successes, idle slots, efficiency),
and determine how such protocols perform across a wide range of test cases.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
  In the future, large retail stores like WalMart may use RFID scanning technology
  at their checkout lanes instead of human clerks or cashiers. In this approach,
  each item in the store has a small micro-chip attached that uniquely identifies the item
  using a K-bit identifier.
  At the checkout, a customer with a basket of N items walks past the RFID scanner,
  which "instantly" scans the basket of goods, identifies each item, determines a
  price for each, calculates the total, and initiates the e-payment process with
  the customer.
</p>
  
<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>
  In this assignment, you will explore the details of the RFID scanning step,
  and devise an efficient MAC protocol to make the checkout process simple and fast.
  You will be told the value of K, which determines the K-bit address space for possible items.
  You will then be given multiple test cases of customers with baskets of goods.
  For each customer, you must determine how many items they have, how long
  it takes the RFID scanner to identify everything in the basket, and how efficient
  it is in doing so.

</p><h2>MAC Protocol Description</h2>

<p></p>
The following MAC protocol is quite different from Ethernet's CSMA/CD or WiFi's CSMA/CA,
but is also simpler, since it is a discrete-time (slotted) protocol.
While this specific protocol will <b>not</b>
be covered in class, the general design principles
and performance tradeoffs of channel access protocols
will be discussed during the lectures on MAC protocols,
and should be helpful to you when undertaking this assignment.
However, the assignment is adequately self-contained that you can
probably start on it even before we cover MAC protocols in class.
<p></p>
<p>
Consider a simple bus-based linear-topology LAN with M nodes (items),
where M is a power of 2 (e.g., M = 8). 
Attached to one end of this network is a special controller
that is in charge of coordinating access to the shared channel
for the M nodes. Assume that the nodes are numbered from
0 to M-1 in binary (e.g., from '000' to '111' if M = 8), from left to right.
</p>

<p>
The RFID scanning protocol conceptually arranges these nodes
into a complete binary tree configuration.
For example, if M = 8,
there are 8 (real) leaf nodes at Level 3,
there are 4 virtual nodes
(each with 2 children) above them
at Level 2,
there are 2 virtual nodes above these at Level 1,
and 1 virtual node 
at Level 0, which is the root of the binary tree.
</p>

<p>
Each virtual node in this binary tree represents
a particular subset of the real nodes (items) in the network.
For example, the root node represents "all nodes in the network",
while the leftmost virtual node on Level 1 represents "all nodes
with an address of the form 0XX", and the rightmost virtual node
on Level 1 represents "all nodes with an address of the form 1XX",
where 'X' denotes a wild-card (i.e., Don't Care) condition.
Similar reasoning applies recursively for other levels of the tree.
For example, the rightmost virtual node on Level 2 represents
"all nodes with an address of the form 11X".
Note that the virtual binary tree structure is conceptual only; the physical
layout of the network is simply a linear bus with M nodes.
</p>

<p>
The controller regulates channel access on this LAN by polling (querying)
certain subsets of the nodes in subsequent steps of the protocol, giving them
permission to transmit.
These polling steps are
referred to as <b>probes</b> in the following description of the protocol.
For example,
suppose that nodes (items) 1, 5, and 6 are present and ready to transmit.
If the controller starts the probing at the root of the tree (Level 0),
a collision would occur on the first probe attempt, since three nodes
all try to transmit at the same time. Subsequent recursive probes
to the two individual nodes on Level 1 
would result in a successful transmission for
node 1 in the first time slot
(since it is the only node in the left subtree whose address starts with '0'),
followed by another collision probe for nodes 5 and 6 in the next
time slot (since both nodes have an address that starts with '1').
Further recursive probes down the right subtree to Level 2 will resolve
the channel access, with a successful transmission by node 5 followed
by a successful transmission by node 6.
In this example scenario, resolving the three original 
data frame transmissions required a total of 5 probe slots:
2 collisions, 3 successes, and 0 idle.
Continuing the example,
if the controller were to start at Level 3 for the given initial
scenario, there would be 8 probes required: 3 of these would lead to
successful transmissions (nodes 1, 5, and 6), and 5 of these would
be idle (wasted) probe slots. In this example,
starting the probing at the root level is 60% efficient
(i.e., 3 successes out of 5 slots), while starting the probing
at the leaf level has an efficiency of 37.5% (i.e., 3 successes out of 8 slots).
</p>

<h2>Your Task</h2>

<p>
  Your task in this assignment is to write a program that models
  this recursive slotted-time MAC protocol, and determines its
  performance on different baskets of items at WalMart.
  Your program can be written in either C or C++.
</p>
<p>
Your program should be easily parameterizable for different values
of <b>K</b>, either on the command line, via user input, or in the code itself.
Your program should be carefully instrumented to keep track of
the different events that can happen during the scanning of a specific basket
of goods, and to report the total time taken for each scan.
Once you have tested your program to ensure that it is working properly,
use it to answer the questions indicated below.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
  Here are some test cases for K=3. These are each small enough that you
  should be able to analyze them manually to verify if your program is correct.

</ol>

<h2>Grading Scheme</h2>

<p>
The proposed grading scheme for the assignment is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>20 marks</b>
for the design and implementation of a program that can successfully
model the RFID scanning protocol described above.
These marks will be based on proper input handling for baskets of goods (2 marks),
MAC protocol modeling (8 marks), suitable instrumentation (4 marks),
output generation (2 marks), as well as general style and readabililty (4 marks).
Your program should be efficient to run for any reasonable value of K (say, up to 16).
</li>
<li>
<b>12 marks</b>
for answers to the questions above (6 questions, 2 marks for each)
</li>
<li>
<b>4 marks</b>
for a brief user manual describing how to compile and use your program
</li>
<li>
<b>4 marks</b>
for a short written summary (at most 1 page)
of your results and observations about the RFID scanning MAC protocol
(There is NO DEMO required for this assignment.)
</li></ul>

<p>
<b>Optional Bonus 1</b>: (<b>2 marks</b>)

Depending on the basket of goods, the RFID scanning protocol might
be more efficient if you were to start scanning at an intermediate level
of the binary tree, rather than always starting at the root or the leaf level.
Modify your program to explore this idea, and try to formulate a heuristic
answer (i.e., rule of thumb) for how to choose the best starting level
for this protocol for a given basket of goods.
Explain your result as best you can.
</p>

<p>
<b>Optional Bonus 2</b>: (<b>2 marks</b>)

From some of the small test cases above, you may get an idea for how to
improve the basic RFID scanning protocol. If so, modify your program to
evaluate the effectiveness of this idea. Show your new results.
</p>

<p>
When you are finished, please submit your individual assignment solution
via D2L, on or before the stated deadline.
</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>
  Start with the simple example test cases for K=3 given above.
  Generate some more test cases of your own if you need them.
  If your protocol works correctly for K=3, then it should work correctly
  for any other value of K (smaller or larger), as well. Really!
</li>
<li>
  This problem lends itself naturally to a recursive solution,
  which should be both elegant and fast. Iterative solutions
  are also fine, however.
</li>
</ul>
