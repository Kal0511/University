<h1>Assignment 1: Web Censorship Proxy (40 marks)</h1>

Due: <b>Friday, October 1, 2021</b> (11:59pm)

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to learn about
the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used by the World Wide Web.
In particular, you will design and implement a Web proxy using HTTP
to demonstrate your understanding of this application-layer protocol.
Along the way, you will also learn a lot about
socket programming, TCP/IP, network debugging, and more.
</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>
  As you know, there is a LOT of undesirable content on the World Wide Web,
  with SpongeBob, Justin Bieber, and Britney Spears being just a few of the most glaring examples of this.
  In this assignment, you are going to develop a Web censorship proxy that blocks access to certain content,
  based on keywords that appear in the URL that is being accessed.
  To keep the assignment simple, we will restrict ourselves only to HTTP (not HTTPS).
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
A <b>Web proxy</b> is a piece of software that functions as an
intermediary between a Web client (browser) and a Web server.
The Web proxy intercepts Web requests from clients and determines
whether they should be transmitted to a Web server or not.
If the request is blocked, the proxy informs the client directly.
If the request is forwarded to the Web server, then any
response that the proxy receives from the Web server is
forwarded back to the client.
From the server's point of view, the proxy <b>is</b> the client,
since that is where the request comes from.
Similarly, from the client's point of view, the proxy <b>is</b> the server,
since that is where the response comes from.
A Web proxy thus provides a single point of control to regulate 
Web access between clients and servers. 
A lot of Calgary schools use Web proxies to limit the types of
Web sites that students are allowed to access.
<a href="http://www.netnanny.com/"> Net Nanny</a> and
<a href="http://www.barracuda.com/"> Barracuda</a>
are examples of commercially available Web proxies.
</p>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>

<p>
In this assignment, you will implement your very own <b>Web censorship proxy</b>,
in either C or C++.
The goals of the assignment are to build a properly functioning
Web proxy for simple Web pages, and then use your proxy
to block undesirable Web content from being delivered to the browser.
</p>

<p>
There are three main pieces of functionality needed in your proxy.
The first is the ability to handle HTTP requests and responses,
while still forwarding them between client and server.
This is called a <b>transparent</b> proxy.
The second is the ability to parse (and possibly modify) HTTP requests,
so that you can extract URL information,
decide whether requests should be blocked or not,
and block them in some reasonable way.
This is called a <b>censorship</b> proxy.
The third piece is to provide a way to update the list of blocked
keywords for your censorship proxy while it is still running.
This is called a <b>dynamically configurable</b> Web censorship proxy.
</p>

<p>
The most important HTTP command for your Web proxy to handle
is the "GET" request, which specifies the URL for an object
to be retrieved. In the basic operation of your proxy, it
should be able to parse, understand, and forward to the Web
server a (possibly modified) version of the client HTTP request.
Similarly, the proxy should be able to parse, understand, 
and return to the client a (possibly modified) version
of the HTTP response that the Web server provided to the proxy.
Please give some careful thought to how your proxy handles
commonly occurring HTTP response codes, such as
200 (OK),
206 (Partial Content),
301 (Moved Permanently),
302 (Found),
304 (Not Modified),
403 (Forbidden),
and
404 (Not Found).
</p>

<p>
You will need at least one TCP socket (i.e., SOCK_STREAM) for client-proxy
communication, and at least one additional TCP socket for each Web server
that your proxy talks to during proxy-server communication.
If you want your proxy to support
multiple concurrent HTTP transactions, you may
need to fork child processes or create threads for request handling.
Each child process or thread will use its own socket instances for its
communications with the client and with the server.
</p>

<p>
When implementing your proxy, feel free to
compile and run your Web proxy on any suitable department machine,
or even your home machine or laptop, but please be aware that you
will ultimately have to demo your proxy to your TA on campus at some point.
You should try to access your proxy from your favourite Web browser
(e.g., Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari),
and computer (either on campus or at home).
To test the proxy, you will have to
configure your Web browser to use your specific Web proxy
(e.g., look for menu selections like Tools, Internet Options, Proxies, Advanced, LAN Settings).
</p>

<p>
As you design and build your Web proxy, give careful consideration
to how you will debug and test it. For example, you may want to
print out
information about requests and responses received, processed, forwarded,
redirected, or altered.
Once you become confident with the basic operation of your Web proxy,
you can toggle off the verbose debugging output.
If you are testing on your home network, you can also use tools
like 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark"> WireShark</a>
to collect network packet traces.
By studying the HTTP messages and TCP/IP packets going to and from your proxy,
you might be able to figure out what is working, what isn't working, and why.
</p>

<p>
When you are finished,
please submit your solution in electronic form to your TA via D2L.
Your submission should include the source code for your Web proxy,
a brief user manual describing how to compile and use your proxy,
and a description of the testing done with your proxy.
Please remember that assignments are to be done individually,
and submitted to your assigned TA on time.
You should also plan to give a brief demo of your proxy to your TA
during a tutorial time slot just after the assignment deadline.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
During your demo, your proxy will be tested on the following test cases:
</p>
<ul>  
<li>  
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/ass1/test1.html"> a very simple Web page </a>
</li>  
<li>  
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/ass1/test2.html"> a Web page with a link to a photo of Floppy</a>
</li>  
<li>  
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/ass1/test3.html"> a Web page with a link to a photo of my curling team</a>
</li>  
<li>  
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/ass1/test-Floppy.html"> a Web page talking about Floppy</a>
</li>  
<li>  
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/ass1/test-curling.html"> a Web page talking about curling</a>
</li>  
<li>  
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/ass1/test-SpongeBob.html"> a Web page talking about SpongeBob</a> 
</li>  
</ul>  

<p>
Once you have these cases working, you can try your proxy on other pages,
such as the Wikipedia page for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk"> Floppy Disks</a>,
to see what happens. 
Good luck, and have fun!
</p>

<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>

<p>
The grading scheme for the assignment is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>10 marks</b>
for the
design and implementation of a functional Web proxy that
can handle simple HTTP GET interactions between client and server,
using either HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.  This basic proxy should be
able to deliver Web pages in unaltered form, and be able to
handle HTTP redirection when it occurs. 
Your implementation should include 
proper use of TCP/IP socket programming in C or C++,
and reasonably commented code.
</li>
<li>
<b>8 marks</b>
for that part of your Web proxy that can parse HTTP requests and responses,
identify what content is being requested, and make proper
decisions about content blocking.
</li>
<li>
<b>8 marks</b>
for that part of your Web proxy that can dynamically update
the list of keywords to be blocked, including both adding and deleting keywords.
</li>
<li>
<b>4 marks</b>
for a
clear and concise user manual (at most 1 page)
that describes how to compile, configure, and
use your Web proxy.
Make sure to indicate the required features 
and optional features (if any) that the proxy supports.
Make sure to clarify where and how the testing was done
(e.g., home, university, office), what works, and what does not. Be honest!
</li>
<li>
<b>10 marks</b>
for a suitable demonstration of your proxy
to your TA in your tutorial section, or to your professor at a mutually convenient time. A successful demo will include marks for the test cases given above,
as well as clear answers to questions asked during your code walk-through.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus (optional)</h2>

<p>
Up to <b> 4 bonus marks</b> will be
given for a Web censorship proxy that can also block undesirable content
based on keywords seen in the <b>body</b> of an <b>HTTP response</b>, rather than just
based on the URL requested. Make sure to show this bonus feature to your TA during the demo.
</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>
This is a <b>very challenging</b> assignment, so please <b>get started early</b>.
You will likely need 7-14 days of thinking/coding/debugging time to
get it fully working.
</li>
<li>
If you have never done socket programming in C/C++ before, you should
make sure to get to your CPSC 441 tutorials on this topic. Don't miss them!
</li>
<li>
Make sure that you have completed and understood
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/assignment0.html"> Assignment 0</a>,
which provides a basic introduction to client-server socket programming.
</li>
<li>
If you don't speak HTTP already,
make sure to get to your CPSC 441 tutorial on this topic.
For example,
the "Content-Length" header in an HTTP response will tell you how big on object is (in bytes),
and the "Content-Type" header is useful for determining the object type
(Hint: you don't want to print binary JPG images onto your screen in debugging messages!)
</li>
<li>
Focus on the basic HTTP proxy functionality first,
by simply forwarding everything that you receive from the client
directly to the server, and everything you receive from the server
directly back to the client. Then add more functionality,
such as request parsing, URL rewriting, or HTTP redirection.
</li>
<li>
Your proxy will need one socket for talking to the client,
and another socket for talking to the server. Make sure to keep track
of which one is which. This is very important to understand!
</li>
<li>
Your proxy will likely
need to dynamically create a socket for every new server that it talks to.
Most of the examples above involve only one server, which is easier.
But you will likely need to generalize this to multiple servers.
If so, make sure to manage these sockets properly.
</li>
<li>
Start with <b>very simple</b> Web pages, such as those indicated above.
Once you have these working, then you can try more complicated Web pages
with lots of embedded objects, possibly from multiple servers.
</li>
<li>
  Be aware that most Web browsers like to cache content locally (i.e., browser cache),
  rather than retrieving it from the server each time it is requested.
  You will want to force a reload from the server each time so that you
  don't get fooled during your testing.
</li>
<li>
  When testing your censorship functionality, start with a single keyword
  that is statically configured (i.e., hardcoded) in your proxy.
  Once this is working as intended, you can add the dynamic configuration
  functionality to update the keyword lists (i.e., adding or removing keywords).
  There are several ways to make your proxy dynamically reconfigurable,
  but some might be harder than others. Don't fret if you can't get it
  fully working; at least you are learning a LOT in the process!
</li>
<li>
You may find that network firewalls block certain ports, which may make
configuration and use of your proxy tricky. For example, it might be easier to do
all of your testing using machines within the CPSC network, rather than external ones.
A good Wireshark trace can help show you what is actually happening on the network.
</li>
<li>
Try to avoid servers that automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS,
since TLS handshakes and encrypted content are well beyond the
intended scope of the assignment.
Let's keep things simple with HTTP only.
</li>
<li>
  The assignment is structured into incremental pieces that are each
  worth partial marks.
  As you get the different pieces of functionality working, make sure to
  save working versions of your code somewhere. Adding new functionality
  sometimes breaks things in a bad way, and you don't want this happening
  just prior to the assignment deadline. Expressed another way, it is
  probably better to have a fully-working partial solution for your demo,
  rather than a partially-working full solution.
  If your code does not even compile, there is not much that you can demo,
  so please be careful if/when making last-minute code changes.
</li>
<li>
Here is a generic
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/checklist.txt"> debugging checklist</a>
for socket programming that you might find helpful. Good luck!
